# Haskell Set Implementation


Functional Programming is a very elegant and beautiful paradigm for me.

A set is an unordered data structures with non-repeated(unique) values. There are multilple ways to implement a Set in a programming language, library or a framework: starting from a simple list/array implementation to the AVL tree implementation. **I enjoy the recursive thinking that Haskell makes you dive in, so I decided to implement a high performing Set ADT using AVL trees**.
